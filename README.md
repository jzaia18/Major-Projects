# Major-Projects

## What This is & Who I am
This is a growing repository of code that will serve as a portfolio to be seen by potential educational institutions or employers.

I am Jake Zaia, a Game Design & Development Major at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Formerly, I studied Computer Science at Stuyvesant High School. Most projects in this portfolio are a result of courses I have taken at these 2 schools.
