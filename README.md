## What This is & Who I am
This is a growing repository of code that will serve as a portfolio to be seen by potential educational institutions or employers.

I am Jake Zaia, a Computer Science Major at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Formerly, I studied Computer Science at Stuyvesant High School. Most projects in this portfolio are a result of courses I have taken at these 2 schools, or are from one of various hackathons I have attended.

Also, check out [my devpost](https://devpost.com/jzaia18) for other projects I've contributed to.
