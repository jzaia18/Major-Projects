## How to Navigate
Depending on the project there are 2 different ways to get to the projects.

### IntroCS Projects
These projects are added as raw source code and do not have git repositories. It is possible to view the files in broswer, but to run these one would have to clone the repository and execute the code manually.

### APCS & Later
These projects are all other github repositories that have been added as submodules. In a browser simply click the link and it will take you to the correct repository.


## Other notable projects
In addition to the projects listed here, I have also done work on:
* [The Stuyvesant CS-Dojo Website](https://dojo.stuycs.org/)
