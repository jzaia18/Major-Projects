## What This is & Who I am
This is a growing repository of code that will serve as a portfolio to be seen by potential educational institutions or employers.

I am Jake Zaia, an undergraduate Computer Science major at the Rochester Institute of Technology. My academic interests nowadays primarily center around quantum computing theory. Soon I plan to head to graduate school to pursue an MS and then a PhD in quantum computing. Formerly, I studied Computer Science at Stuyvesant High School. Most projects in this portfolio are a result of particularly interesting courses I have taken, or are from one of various hackathons I have attended, with some personal projects sprinkled in.

For more information about me, check out [my official website](https://jzaia.net).

Also, check out [my devpost](https://devpost.com/jzaia18) for other projects I've contributed to.
